Hi welcome to the read me.


This website is a site to show off my hobby, warships. 
Warships are my main hobby, learning about their history, the people that served on them, the weapons and planes aboard them, etc. 
The ships have personality to them. They have names, and are cities to the people that serve aboard them. 

Hopefully this site showcases my passion for these magnifigant vessals. 

The site should simply run after opening it in a web browser.

Thank you.
